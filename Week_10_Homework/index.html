                        This choropleth map is displays Metropolitan Melbourne suburbs, using colour to represent
                        variations
                        in the average property sale price. It illustrates spatial patterns and differences in property
                        values
                        across the Metropolitan area. Each suburb is shaded according to its respective average sale
                        price,
                        with darker colors indicating higher prices and lighter shades representing lower ones.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        For suburbs with no property sale data, a grey hue is used to indicate that no data was
                        collected.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        A clear spatial trend which is evident is that property sale prices are higher, as the distance
                        to the
                        CBD decreases. Within this pattern, we also notice two price 'hot-spots' in the Eastern and
                        South-Eastern
                        suburbs, where prices are especially high.

                        This stacked bar chart serves as a comprehensive visual representation of
                        property sales within a specific council area in Metropolitan Melbourne. Each bar on the chart
                        corresponds to a suburb within the chosen council area.

                        <br>
                        Encoded using colour hue is the property type, which can be 'house', 'townhouse', or
                        'units/apartments'.
                        This encoding allows us to see the distribution of how many of each type of property has been
                        sold in an area.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In addition to this, annotations are shown above each bar, indicating the total number of
                        property sales in a suburb.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        At any one point, data is only shown for one council area to avoid cognitive overload. This is
                        due to the high number of suburbs in Metropolitan Melbourne.
